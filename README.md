add to memory game - 
credit sounds to me in presonus studio one.
validate CSS, html and JS(via jShint)



bugs - 
*background images for divs showing in python server preview but not in github live page or gitpod preview - fixed by changing relative path.
responsiveness of overlays - added media queery
githubpages not loading assets with error 404. 

fix append to remove appended stars after win multiple times. - fixed with a loop that checks if there is inner html in the victory text and removes it on game start. 

if statement to check remaining time and assign stars - first if statement always true no matter what time. tried logging current time to console to see what im checking against. tried googling loops. fixed by double checking syntax and rewriting the code and testing.
bootstrap css overriding rules - fixed by making more specific rules

match sound not playing after match in short succession - fixed by shortening the audio file and removing silence at the end

mute button - i couldnt get the event listener on the mute button to both change the FA icon AND pay/pause the background music - fixed by making the icon toggle function call the music toggle function after changing the FA class.
mute button works fine but after rester it runs both functions on conditional statement. - fixed by moving my click function into the right constructor and writing a custom function that remembers if music was muted or not. 

css issue in ios - mention this and document it well as to how u tested and why
